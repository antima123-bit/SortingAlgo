📊 Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
📌 Overview
This project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer that provides an interactive way to understand how sorting algorithms work. It features Selection Sort and dynamically updates the sorting process with smooth animations.

✨ Features
🎨 Visual Representation of sorting algorithms
🔄 Random Data Generation for testing different cases
⏳ Step-by-Step Animation for better understanding
🎥 Video Demo for easy reference
🎬 Demo

📌 Replace video_link_here with your hosted video link (e.g., YouTube, GitHub video upload, or a GIF).

🛠 Tech Stack
HTML5 Canvas 🎨
JavaScript (ES6+) 🚀
CSS (Basic Styling) 🎭
🚀 Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/sorting-visualizer.git
Open the index.html file in a browser.

🎯 Usage
Click the Randomize button to generate new data.
Enter custom numbers (comma-separated) if desired.
Click the Sort button to see the sorting algorithm in action.
Watch as the elements swap positions dynamically!
📝 Code Explanation
Canvas Setup: Initializes the drawing area.
drawArray(): Handles the visualization of sorting steps.
Selection Sort Algorithm: Highlights comparisons and swaps.
Event Listeners: Handles user interactions for generating and sorting data.
🚀 Future Improvements
✅ Add more sorting algorithms like Quick Sort & Merge Sort

✅ Implement speed control for animations

✅ Improve UI with a better design
